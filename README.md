# Methane Plume Detection using Vision Transformer (ViT)

This repository contains code and experiments for detecting methane plumes from hyperspectral satellite imagery using a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. The model processes high-resolution multispectral data to identify methane emission sources with improved accuracy and generalization.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and accurate detection of its emissions is crucial for understanding and mitigating climate change impacts.  
In this project, we implement a ViT for methane plume detection and analysis, leveraging a subset of PlumeBed dataset, image-level classification labeling, and computer vision methods.
